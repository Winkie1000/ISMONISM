# ISMONISM
ISMONISM (*In Start Menu Or Not In Start Menu*) is an utility for scanning folder(s), to find files for which there is no matching shortcut in user configurable folder(s).

It was originally designed with the Windows Start Menu in mind. By default is searches for executables (.exe) in the `Program Files` folders. However, both the extensions and search folders are user configurable.
