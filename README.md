ISMONISM (*In Start Menu Or Not In Start Menu*) is an utility for scanning folders recursively, to find files for which there is no matching shortcut in (a subfolder of) any user-defined folder.

This utility was originally created with the Windows Start Menu in mind. By default it searches for executables (.exe) in the `Program Files` folders. However, both the extension(s) to search for and the search folder(s) are user configurable.

It has the ability to create shortcuts of found items in a user configurable 'personal shortcut folder' (By default a subfolder of the Start Menu).
